# Algorithm_Visualization
This was my first project and also me learning how to use github! It is a program which aids in visulization of 3 simple sorting algorithms that I learnt in my first year of Computer Science (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort). I also learnt how to implement multithreading which prevented alot of crashing/freezing in my program! 

Skills/Concecpts used:
- Object oriented programming with Python
- Sorting Algorithms 
- Tkinter --> Visual representation of sorting algorithm
- Multithreading --> Speed up the program by allocating resources/new threads when we need to change the gui
- Basic Geometry --> To draw the bars evenly across the screen, as well as to move them.

Current bugs/problems:
- When closing the program the thread appears to continue to run. As I continue to learn more about threading I will eventually fix this problem.

Next steps:
- Add MergeSort and Quicksort Algorithms
- Add features which can stop, slow, speedup or pause the program

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvement please contact me:
